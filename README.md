###### Stata version required: at least 14.2
Stata package for Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM).

To use the package copy the ado, mlib, data and help files in one of the Stata's system directories. The easiest way to have the package working is to copy everything in the `PERSONAL` directory returned by the `adopath` command.

The `examples.do` file contains many examples taken from the literature as well as some simulated data examples.

*Note:* the mlib file provided has been compiled using Stata 15. If you are using Stata 14, copy the mlib file included in the mlib/Stata 14 directory.

As a reference, you can refer to the following paper accepted by the Journal of Statistical Sofwtare:
