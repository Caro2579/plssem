## Current release: 0.3.0
## Stata version required: at least 14.2
Stata package for Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM).

To use the package copy the ado, mo, data and help files in one of the Stata's system directories. The easiest way to have the package working is to copy everything in the `PERSONAL` directory returned by the `adopath` command.

The `examples.do` file contains many examples taken from the literature as well as some simulated data examples.
